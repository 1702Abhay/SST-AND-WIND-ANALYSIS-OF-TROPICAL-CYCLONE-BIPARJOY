# SST-AND-WIND-ANALYSIS-OF-TROPICAL-CYCLONE-BIPARJOY
This project investigates the formation, intensity, and path of Cyclone Biparjoy (June 2023), with an in-depth analysis of sea surface temperature (SST) and wind patterns across the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal.

# Key Features:
Climatology and SST Trends:   Analyzed SST changes in the North Indian Ocean (1990-2023) to track warming trends and potential cyclonic conditions.
Cyclone Genesis and SST Anomalies: Examined SST anomalies in May-June to identify conditions leading to cyclone formation.
Wind Analysis: Conducted a multi-level wind analysis at 850 hPa, 500 hPa, and 200 hPa to understand cyclone structure, intensity, and movement.
Cyclone Lifecycle: Analyzed track and central pressure, capturing Cyclone Biparjoy's 13-day duration, path shifts, and peak intensity.
# Libraries Used:
Pandas for data manipulation and analysis
NumPy for numerical operations
Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
xarray for handling large, multi-dimensional climate data
Cartopy for geospatial plotting and mapping cyclone paths
# Data Sources:
ERA5 Reanalysis from Copernicus for SST and wind data
IMD for best-track cyclone data, central pressure, and wind speeds
References:
The study is informed by research papers on tropical cyclone dynamics, SST anomalies, and atmospheric influences on cyclone formation and behavior.

# Conclusion:
SST in the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal has risen over the past 30 years, linked to increased cyclone frequency and intensity.
Cyclone Biparjoy followed a complex path with frequent directional changes, driven by varying anticyclonic forces over the region.
Wind convergence and divergence across different atmospheric levels provided insights into the cycloneâ€™s strength and longevity.
This project enhances understanding of cyclone behavior and supports improved forecasting and disaster response strategies.
